7. 💸 How Balance Works
No direct access to real bank accounts.

The virtual balance is simply calculated as:

Balance = Total Room Payments – Total Expenses
The UPI payment flow is handled by deep links and QR codes associated with each room number. Payments are tracked, and receipts are automatically generated and linked to the respective room.

Languages: English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu (expandable).

Language selection happens at the time of login or in settings, using react-i18next.
